[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01634)

This paper presents ObsNet for OOD segmentation task, which is not only able to segment trained objects (in distribution - ID) but also recognize unseen object from the training set (out-of-distribution - OOD).

ObsNet consists of Segmentation Network (SegNet) for semantic segmentation and Observer Network (ObsNet) for OOD detection with adversarial attack training. The method framework includes two steps: (i) training SegNet for semantic segmentation tasks, (ii) freezing SegNet and using its weight to initialize ObsNet, then training ObsNet for OOD detection tasks with adversarial learning.

The paper performed experiments on 3 OOD datasets: StreetHazards, CamVid, and BBD Anomaly. Each dataset consists of train/val test with ID objects, and test set with both ID and OOD objects. 

## Improvements from the [original repository](https://github.com/valeoai/obsnet)

- [x] More details instructions for preparing datasets
- [x] Include [Segmenter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05633) (ViT-based) as model
- [x] Training Segmentation Network  with detailed instructions
- [x] Better code management for both SegNet and ObsNet 
- [x] Logging, tracking, and visualizing experiments with [WandB](https://wandb.ai/) (better than TensorBoard for sure ðŸ˜‰)

## Datasets

### CamVid
CamVid Dataset can be download here: http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/

The CamvidOOD dataset is composed of the same number of images as the classic CamVid. However, each image of the testing set contains an out-of-distribution animal.
You can download the CamVidOOD split in the release "CamVid OOD". Once CamVid and CamVidOOD are downloaded, execute the following line in your shell:
    
    $ cd /path/where/you/download/camvidood/
    $ unzip CamVidOOD.zip
    $ mv -r /path/where/you/download/camvidood/test_ood/ /path/to/dataset/CamVid/
    $ mv -r /path/where/you/download/camvidood/test_ood.txt /path/to/dataset/CamVid/

## Training/Testing
According to the paper, the SegNet must be trained in prior to obtain the weight model. Then, the trained (SegNet) model is then freezed (as pre-trained model) feeding to Obsnet to training the OOD segmentation alone.

Unlike the original repository, we provide both SegNet and ObsNet training scheme, supporting CNN-based architectures (SegNet, DeepLabV3+) and ViT-based architecture (Segmenter). The first thing to do is training SegNet model first, then using its trained weight model for training ObsNet

### SegNet

+ **Training** (includes testing in the end):
    ```
    python main_segnet.py --dataset <dataset name> --model <model name> --wandb <this flag is optional>
    ```
    + The segnet trained weight model is automatically generated in `logs/<log_id>` with `log_id = segnet_<dataset_name>_<model_name>_<datetime>`. For example:`segnet_StreetHazards_segnet_20230408@083545`
    + After training, please move the SegNet trained model, (i.e, `best.pth`) to folder `segnet_file\` for ObsNet training 
+ **Testing** only:
    ```
    python main_segnet.py --dataset <dataset name> --model <model name> --logs <log_id> --test
    ```
    + We currently perfrom test on validation set, because the test set includes OOD objects that are inappropriate for evaluation the semantic segmentation tasks.
    + By default, the selected segnet weight is `logs/<log_id>/best.pth`
    + If you want to perform test on any segnet pretrained model, just store the model file on `segnet_file/` and using flag `--segnet_file <model name>`. In this case, `--segnet_file` automatically **ovewrites** the `--log` options. Thus you don't have to set value for `--log`
+ **Example**: Training StreetHazards on Segmenter for Segnet:  
    ```
    # training:
        python main_segnet.py --dataset StreetHazards --model segmenter --wandb
    # testing:
        python main_segnet.py --dataset StreetHazards --model segmenter --log segnet_StreetHazards_segmenter_20230408@092021 --test
    ```

### ObsNet

+ **Training** (includes testing in the end):
    ```
      python main_obsnet.py --model <model name> --data <dataset name> --adv <type of adversarial attack> --segnet_file <segnet_file name> --no_pretrained <optional> --wandb <optional>
    ```
    + `--no_pretrained`: No initialize the weight of the ObsNet with those of the SegNet
    + `--wandb`: log in WandB server
    + The obsnet trained weight model is automatically generated in `logs/<log_id>` with `log_id = obsnet_<dataset_name>_<model_name>_<datetime>`. For example: `obsnet_StreetHazards_segnet_20230408@083545`
    + After training, please move the ObsNet trained model to folder `obsnet_file\`

+ **Testing** only:
    ```
      python main_obsnet.py --model <model name> --data <dataset name> --adv <type of adversarial attack> --segnet_file <segnet_file name> --log <log_id> --test
    ```
    + Require both `--segnet_file <model_name.pth>` and `--log <log_id>` to have value. By default, the two models is automatically selected from `segnet_file/<model_name.pth>` and `logs/<log_id>/best.pth`
    + If you want to perform test on any obsnet pretrained model, just store the model file on `obsnet_file/` and using flag `--obsnet_file <model name>`. In this case, `--segnet_file` automatically **ovewrites** the `--log` options. Thus you don't have to set value for `--log`
+ **Example**: Training StreetHazards on Segmenter for ObsNet
    ```
    # training:
        python main_obsnet.py --model segmenter --data StreetHazards --adv min_random_patch --segnet_file  Segmenter_StreetHazards.pth --wandb
    # testing: 
        python main_obsnet.py --model segmenter --data StreetHazards --adv min_random_patch --segnet_file  Segmenter_StreetHazards.pth --log obsnet_StreetHazards_segnet_20230408@083545 --test 
    ```

### Inference 

You can perfom inference on a batch of images. 

Example:

    python inference.py --img_folder "<path to image folder>" --segnet_file "path to segnet" --obsnet_file "path to obsnet" --data "CityScapes" --model "raod_anomaly"    

## Pretrained ObsNet Models

Pretrained model for ObsNet are available in this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11S9oK-Bk9PoP2728ldrROQKAa8Q3iUxx?usp=sharing). Please save on `obsnet_file/`
